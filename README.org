#+TITLE: lyrics-fetcher.el

A package to fetch song lyrics and album covers. Integrates with EMMS.

As of now, the only available backend is [[https://genius.com/][genius.com]], but in principle, new ones can be added.

* Installation
As the package isn't yet available anywhere but in this repository, you can clone the repository, add it to the =load-path= and =require= the package:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'lyrics-fetcher)
#+end_src

My preferred way is to use =use-package= with =straight=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package lyrics-fetcher
  :straight (:host github :repo "SqrtMinusOne/lyrics-fetcher.el")
  :after (emms))
#+end_src

Install [[https://imagemagick.org/index.php][imagemagick]] if you want to download covers.

Set [[https://docs.genius.com/][genius.com]] client access token. To do that, [[https://genius.com/api-clients/new][create a new client,]] click "Generate Access Token" and put the result to the =lyrics-fetcher-genius-access-token= variable. I do this with password-store:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq lyrics-fetcher-genius-access-token
      (password-store-get "My_Online/APIs/genius.com"))
#+end_src

But of course, you can just hardcode the string.

* Usage
Available commands:
- ~M-x lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics~ - show lyrics for the current playing track.

  The resulting lyric files are saved to the ~lyrics-fetcher-lyrics-folder~ and have the ~lyrics-fetcher-lyrics-file-extension~ extension. The folder will be created if it doesn't exist.

  By default, the function opens an already saved lyrics file if one exists, otherwise tries to fetch the lyrics.

  If called with =C-u=, then tries to fetch the text regardless of the latter.

  If called with =C-u C-u=, prompts the user to select a matching song. That is helpful when there are multiple songs with similar names, and the top one isn't the right one.

  If called with =C-u C-u C-u=, edit the search query in minibuffer before sending. This is helpful when there is extra information in the song title which prevents the API from finding the song.
- ~M-x lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics-query~ - fetch lyrics by a text query.

  Modified by =C-u= the same way as ~lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics~.

EMMS integration:
- ~M-x lyrics-fetcher-emms-browser-show-at-point~ - fetch data for the current point in EMMS browser.

  If the point contains just one song, it will be fetched the usual way and lyrics will be shown upon successful completion.

  If the point contains many songs (e.g. it's an album), the lyrics will be fetched consequentially for every song. The process then will stop at the first failure.

  Modified by =C-u= the same way as ~lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics~.
- ~M-x lyrics-fetcher-emms-browser-fetch-covers-at-point~ - fetch album covers for the current point in the EMMS browser.

  This functionality requires songs' directories to be grouped by albums, i.e. one album per one folder.

  The files will be saved to the folder with names like "cover_small.jpg", "cover_med.jpg", "cover_large.jpg".

  You can customize the sizes via the ~lyrics-fetcher-small-cover-size~ and ~lyrics-fetcher-medium-cover-size~ variables.

  Modified by =C-u= the same way as ~lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics~.
- ~M-x lyrics-fetcher-emms-browser-open-large-cover-at-point~ - open large_cover for the current point in EMMS browser.

Lyric view mode keybindings:
- =q= - close the lyrics buffer
- =r= - refetch the lyrics in the buffer
* Customization and extension
** Lyrics file naming and location
As was outlined above, lyrics files are saved to ~lyrics-fetcher-lyrics-folder~ and have an extension set in ~lyrics-fetcher-lyrics-file-extension~.

Take a look at the ~lyrics-fetcher-format-song-name-method~ and ~lyrics-fetcher-format-file-name-method~ variables if you want to customize the lyrics buffer and file naming.
** Using another player than EMMS
To use another player, customize ~lyrics-fetcher-current-track-method~.

This variable contains a function that returns the current playing track. The return format has to be either a string or (recommended) an EMMS-like alist, which has to have the following fields:
- =info-artist= or =info-albumartist=
- =info-title=
** Adding another backend
A function to perform the lyric fetching is set in ~lyrics-fetcher-fetch-method~.

The function has to receive 3 arguments:
- =track= - a string or alist, as outlined [[*Using other player than EMMS][above]].
- =callback= - the function which has to be called with the resulting lyrics string
- =sync= - if non-nil, inquire the user about the possible choices. This is called =sync= because then it is reasonable to perform the request synchronously, as otherwise, it won't be nice to suddenly throw a prompt at the user.

The album cover fetching is similar. The corresponding function is set in ~lyrics-fetcher-download-cover-method~ and has to receive the following parameters:
- =track= - as above
- =callback= - has to be called with the path to the resulting file. This file should be named =cover_large.<extension>=.
- =folder= - where the file has to be put
- =sync= - as above.

The first argument is =track= because in EMMS all the required information is stored in tracks, and album data is deduced from tracks. So this package just takes a sample track in the album.
