;;; Commentary:

;; A package to fetch song lyrics and album covers, mainly to use with
;; EMMS.
;;
;; Main commands:
;; - `lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics' - show lyrics for the current
;;    playing track.
;; - `lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics-query' - show lyrics by a
;;    text query.
;; - `lyrics-fetcher-emms-browser-show-at-point' - show lyrics
;;    for the current point in EMMS browser.
;; - `lyrics-fetcher-emms-browser-fetch-covers-at-point' - fetch
;;    album covers for the current point in the EMMS browser.
;; - `lyrics-fetcher-use-backend' - select a backend.
;;
;; Take a look at the package README.org at
;; <https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/lyrics-fetcher.el> for more
;; information.

TRACK can be either a string or an EMMS alist.  If TRACK is not
set, for instance when called interactively, then
`lyrics-fetcher-current-track-method' will be used to get the
current playing track.

By default, opens already saved lyrics file if one exists,
otherwise performs fetch according to
`lyrics-fetcher-current-track-method'.  The resulting file will be
saved with a name from `lyrics-fetcher-format-file-name-method'.

Resulting lyric files are saved to the
`lyrics-fetcher-lyrics-folder' and have the
`lyrics-fetcher-lyrics-file-extension' extension

If SUPPRESS-OPEN is non-nil, don't pop up a window with lyrics.  This
is useful when performing a mass fetch.

If SUPPRESS-SWITCH is non-nil, create a buffer with lyrics but
don't switch to it.

If CALLBACK is non-nil, call it with the resulting filename.

If called with \\[universal-argument] or FORCE-FETCH is non-nil, then
always refetch the lyrics text.

If called with \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument] or SYNC
is non-nil, then ask the user to select a matching song.  This may be
useful if there are multiple tracks with similar names, and the top
one isn’t the one required.

If called with \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]
\\[universal-argument] or EDIT is non-nil, edit the search query
in minibuffer before sending.  This is helpful when there is
extra information in the song title which prevents the API from
finding the song."
